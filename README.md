MCO2 Enhanced Token (Experimental)
An advanced, feature-rich ESG-compliant token built on Ethereum's Sepolia testnet. 
This project is an enhanced, experimental version of the original MCO2 token, created as a learning exercise for our university's DeFi Society.

Learning Project Notice: This is one of our first major Solidity projects. 
It is deployed on a testnet for a reason! While we've done our best, there may be undiscovered bugs, inefficiencies, or design anti-patterns.
We welcome feedback and contributions to help us learn and improve.
